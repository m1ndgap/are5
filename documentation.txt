global:

should I put styles into the page folder or the global folder? BEM guidelines say put it in module folders where should i put global styles then?


index:

-menu:

I used absolute positioning for left and rightmost elements to have better control when I'm working on responsive.
Should they be done as the part of menu flex?

-index_1_intro

basic flex


-index_2_numbers

I used two flexboxes inside a flexbox to position four elements in two columns, I wonder if there is a better way to do this
because adjusting elements seemed tricky and I wasnt able to achieve perfect result
