index:

-menu:

I used absolute positioning for left and rightmost elements to have better control when I'm working on responsive. Should they be done as the part of menu flex?

-index_1_intro

basic flex


-index_2_numbers

I used two flexboxes to position four elements in two columns, I wonder if there is a better way to do this
